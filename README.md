# Utilities for the Raspberry Pi Power HAT
These are the command line utilities for interfacing with the Power HAT's components.

## Building and Installing
First, clone this repository on your Raspberry Pi:
>git clone https://github.com/AndiceLabs/PowerUtils.STM

Then, change into the *PowerUtils.STM* directory and build:
>make

You should wind up with two executables: *power* and *ina219*.  Copy these somewhere in your path.  I like to use ~/bin.
